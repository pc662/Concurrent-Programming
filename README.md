# Concurrent-Programming

A place where I can store the assignments given to me in concurrent programming as reference.

Language: C++
IDE: VSCode

Things should compile and run successfully through tux.

Notes:

I've learned more about makefiles in one week of this class than I did the whole term from CS260.

The first assignment was rough but it was a good way to give a crash course on C++. It is pretty fun.

The mandelbrot assignment presented the most difficulty with figuring out why the array would not go into the threads. Issue turned out to be that an array with such a large size
could not be initialized. Created a vector instead.

The third assignment has proven to be the easiest of the three. I do better with interpretation than with logic it seems. It was nice being able to not struggle too long with a HW assignment.

The fourth assignment was of a medium difficulty. The first implementation I tried suffered from a race condition but the final product was something I was pretty satisfied with.

The fifth assignment was the weirdest for me. The easiest implementation was not the intended method, was easy, and met the requirements.

The sixth and seventh assignments were theory based. We moved from coding to looking at charts of how threads could potentially interleave.

The eighth assignment was easier than it looked. We implemented a BST with threads. It was mostly just remaking a BST but with locks and some threads added into it.

The ninth assignment, or the last one, was one which I had some good fun with. Threadpooling was everything we worked up to and surprisingly, I didn't find much challenge here.

Overall, I managed to finish the class with an A+ despite it being very stressful. However, I am proud of that since I started knowing nothing of C++ and left the course knowing more about threads and being pretty familiar with a language I thought I'd despise.
