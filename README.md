# Concurrent-Programming

A place where I can store the assignments given to me in concurrent programming as reference.

Language: C++
IDE: VSCode

Things should compile and run successfully through tux.

Notes:

I've learned more about makefiles in one week of this class than I did the whole term from CS260.

The first assignment was rough but it was a good way to give a crash course on C++. It is pretty fun.

The mandelbrot assignment presented the most difficulty with figuring out why the array would not go into the threads. Issue turned out to be that an array with such a large size
could not be initialized. Created a vector instead.

The third assignment has proven to be the easiest of the three. I do better with interpretation than with logic it seems. It was nice being able to not struggle too long with a HW assignment.
